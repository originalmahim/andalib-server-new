### Cloning and Installation Guide for Server Repository:

To clone and install the server project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/originalmahim/andalib-server-new.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory using the following command:

   ```
   cd andalib-server-new
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm. Run the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Since there is no `.env` file provided, you need to create one and configure necessary environment variables. This may include variables for database connection, API keys, and other configurations. Refer to the project documentation or contact the project administrators for specific details on environment variable setup.

5. After setting up the environment variables, you can start the server locally using npm. Run the following command:

   ```
   nodemon start
   ```

6. Your server should now be running locally. You can access it at the specified port or endpoint depending on the configuration.
